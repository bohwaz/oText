## Important note

This is a **personnal** project I made for myself.

You are free to use it if you want to, but I won’t maintain features I do not use. As such, some features might be removed, added or altered (including the database) after an update.

Also, I am open to ideas, bugreports or requests, but keep in mind that I’ll probably say no to suggestions. Your idea might be good, but if I don’t need some feature for myself, I won’t implement it.
